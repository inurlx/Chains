# [ Chains V3.0 ] - With the source code :eyes:

Chinas is an encryption tool made with C++, The good thing about this tool is that the encryption data it generates can only be decrypted by the same user!

For an example if you registered in the tool with following info:  
user: test  
pass: test1  
and start generating encrypted data, the only who who has the ability of decrypting the data is the one who has the username as "test" and the password as "test1" :smile:
